# Personal Portfolio & Blog

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website and blog. It's a static site built with HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript, designed to showcase my projects, experience, and thoughts on technology.

## Features

-   **Responsive Design:** Adapts to various screen sizes from mobile to desktop.
-   **Interactive Background:** Uses `tsParticles` for a dynamic particle effect.
-   **Scroll Animations:** Subtle fade-in animations on scroll implemented with the `IntersectionObserver` API.
-   **Blog Section:** A dedicated space for articles on AI, systems design, and technology.
-   **Syntax Highlighting:** Uses `highlight.js` for code blocks in blog posts.
-   **Math Rendering:** Uses `KaTeX` for displaying mathematical formulas.

## Tech Stack

-   HTML5
-   CSS3 (with Flexbox and Grid)

## Running Locally

Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. For the best experience (to avoid potential CORS issues with local files), it's recommended to use a simple local server. If you have Python installed, you can run:

```bash
# For Python 3
python -m http.server
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
